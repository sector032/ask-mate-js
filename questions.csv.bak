,,,2,Wordpress loading multiple jQuery Versions,"I developed a plugin that uses the jquery booklet plugin (http://builtbywill.com/booklet/#/) this plugin binds a function to $ so I cann call $('.myBook').booklet();

I could easy managing the loading order with wp_enqueue_script so first I load jquery then I load booklet so everything is fine.

BUT in my theme i also using jquery via webpack so the loading order is now following:

jquery
booklet
app.js (bundled file with webpack, including jquery)",
